This guide shows how to control the ESP32 or ESP8266 NodeMCU GPIOs from anywhere in the world using Telegram. As an example, weâ€™ll control an LED, but you can control any other output. You just need to send a message to your Telegram Bot to set your outputs HIGH or LOW. The ESP boards will be programmed using Arduino IDE.
